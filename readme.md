Note and code for  [CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms)
==================================================================================

The note will be written using [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
syntax, cus it's nice and integrate well with my daily journal. Other note will
be written in markdown to be well rendered by github.

The code, will be implemented in Python, Ruby, Javascript (nodejs) and Golang. I
hope that I can accomplish this task
